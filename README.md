# PortfolioProjects
A place to gather some of the smaller projects I have completed that showcase my skills as Data Analyst.

These projects take on average less than a day to complete, and are meant as a small showcase - but also a great place for me to fall back on for review and learning new skills. 

If you have any questions about the projects or repository, I'd be very happy to talk. Send me an email at: wolkoff.97@gmail.com
